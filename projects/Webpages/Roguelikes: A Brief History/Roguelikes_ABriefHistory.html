		<h3 align='left'># Introduction</h3>
		
		<p align='left'>On this page, I will be discussing a specific <span style="color: #da5bd6;">sub-genre of role-playing games (RPGs)</span> traditionally known as <span style="color: #da5bd6;">"roguelike"</span>.
		</p>
		
		<p align='left'>
			According to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roguelike&oldid=1193779197'><em>"Roguelike"</em></a> entry on 
			<em>Wikipedia</em> ("Roguelike," 2024), a <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> is a style of RPG traditionally involving the following characteristics:
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #cfc041;"><em>"dungeon-crawl"</em></span></li>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">the primary objective is to explore a dungeon-like setting, 
			fighting monsters and collecting items in pursuit of a final goal</span></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			
			<li><span style="color: #cfc041;"><em>procedurally-generated levels</em></span>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">the layout and characteristics of game levels
			are randomized on each playthrough using procedural generation techniques</span></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			
			<li><span style="color: #cfc041;"><em>turn-based gameplay</em></span></li>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">events in-game occur on a turn-by-turn basis, typically
			with level elements updating on each individual keypress by the player</span></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			
			<li><span style="color: #cfc041;"><em>grid-based movement</em></span></li>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">player character and NPC movement occurs on a grid structure,
			with each movement happening across cells of consistent height and width</span></li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			
			<li><span style="color: #cfc041;"><em>permanent player character death ("permadeath")</em></span></li>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">upon depletion of the player character's health stat, all game progression is lost, requiring players to start
			from scratch on their next playthrough</span></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h3 align='left'># Why Roguelikes?</h3>
		<p align='left'>
			I have had a fondness for roguelikes ever since I was a kid, when my dad and I would play <a href='https://www.nethack.org/'><em>NetHack</em></a> together. <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span>
			was a roguelike that released in 1987 and took inspiration from the original <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rogue_(video_game)&oldid=1191758861'><em>Rogue</em></a>.
			<br><br>
		
			As a kid, I had	always been a fan of video games, but it was infrequent that my dad and I shared interest in the same game. However, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span> was a game that my dad had played as a kid, himself,
			so when he came across a more modern iteration of the game available online and introduced it to me, we instantly bonded over the experience. I have fond memories of him and I spending
			entire summer afternoons taking turns playing the game. <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span> is notoriously difficult, so we never really "beat" the game, and my dad was, admittedly, much better
			at it than I was, but I was so excited about finally having a game to share with him, that it never mattered if we won.
			<br><br>
		
			Years later, I still have a fondness for roguelikes (though I am still not very good at them). Today, there are much nicer-looking roguelikes being made by indie game developers,
			complete with more modernized features and functionalities (see <a href='https://www.cavesofqud.com/'><em>Caves of Qud</em></a>) to meet the standards of today's much more 
			advanced gaming industry.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 align='left'># A Brief History</h3>
		<p align='left'>What follows is a brief retelling of the history of the <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre -- from the inspiration for the original <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>, to the most modern
		renditions of the genre.
		
		<h4><span style="color: #cfc041;">Pre-<em>Rogue</em></span> // <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> (1976)</h4>
		<p style='margin-left: 30px;'>
			<span style="color: #b1c9c3;">Designed by developer Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe computer and released in 1976, 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colossal_Cave_Adventure&oldid=1181029941'><em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em></a>
			is a "text-based adventure game" in which players explore a sprawling, mysterious cave system in search for treasure ("Colossal Cave Adventure," 2023). Players move through and interact with the game world by inputting
			one- or two-word commands to the game's user interface. 
			<br><br>
			
			The release of <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em></span> proved to be a watershed event in the history of gaming, as it directly inspired the creation of several other games in its era,
			"including <em>Zork</em> (1977), <em>Adventureland</em> (1978), <em>Mystery House</em> (1980), <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em> (1980)</span>, and <em>Adventure</em> (1980), which [became] the foundations of the <em>interactive
			fiction</em>, <em>adventure</em>, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>roguelike</em></span>, and <em>action-adventure</em> genres."  
			</span>
		</p>

			<p align='center'><span style='color: #f15f22'>Colossal Cave Adventure (1976)</span></p>
		</p>
		
		<br>
			
		<h4><span style="color: #cfc041;">The Grandfather of Roguelikes</span> // <em>Rogue</em> (1980)</h4>	
		<p style='margin-left: 30px;'>
			<span style="color: #b1c9c3;">Designed by developers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman for Unix-based minicomputer systems and released in 1980 ("Rogue [video game]," 2023), 
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rogue_(video_game)&oldid=1191758861'><em>Rogue</em></a> is considered to be the first of its kind, hence why the heavily-expanded-upon genre is still referred to as 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;">"<em>Rogue</em>-like"</span> today. 
			<br><br>
			
			Like its inspiration, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em></span>,
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span> lets players roleplay as an adventurer in an underground labyrinth, searching for treasure -- specifically, the Amulet of Yendor. However, unlike 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>CCA</em></span>, in <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>, players are able to control the movement of a character sprite on-screen with specific keypresses, rather than simply 
			imagining the movement of their character through the dungeon, directed by short console commands. Additionally, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span> is <span style="color: #cfc041;">turn-based</span>, with player 
			movement and actions taking place on a square <span style="color: #cfc041;">grid</span>, with on-screen elements (such as the player character, non-player characters, enemies, items, and environmental features like walls and doors) 
			represented in <em>ASCII</em> or other <em>fixed character sets</em> in a game world that is entirely <span style="color: #cfc041;">procedurally generated</span> on each playthrough. One of the most iconic characteristics of 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span> that has been a staple in the genre since its release is <span style="color: #cfc041;">permanent player character death ("permadeath")</span>, which means that a player's playthrough
			comes to an absolute end whenever their character's health stat is depleted -- a serious challenge not for the faint of heart, which has prevailed into today's newest renditions of the genre.
			</span>

		<h4><span style="color: #cfc041;">Early Roguelikes</span> // <em>Hack</em> (1982), <em>Moria</em> (1983)</h4>
		<p style='margin-left: 30px;'><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">Though <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue's</em></span> developers never released the source code behind their hit title, their game was so popular at the time that it spawned
			several spin-offs -- the first <span style="color: #da5bd6;">"Rogue-likes"</span> -- which were created from scratch by their respective developers in order to emulate and expand upon the concepts introduced in 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>. Of the many early "roguelikes" developed at this time, two of the most influential were <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> and <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span>.
			<br><br>
			
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hack_(video_game)&oldid=1175539245'><em>Hack</em></a> was developed originally by Jay Fenlason in 1982, but the most popular iteration of the game (and a much expanded version, at that)
			was developed by Andries Brouwer and released in 1984 ("Hack [video game]," 2023). In <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> -- much like in <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span> -- game elements are represented
			on-screen in a graphical user interface using arrangements of <em>ASCII</em> or <em>Extended ASCII</em> character sets. All of the key <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> characteristics are present in 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> -- the primary objective of the game is to "crawl" (i.e., explore) a labyrinthian dungeon, descending deeper into the earth while fighting monsters and collecting items in pursuit of the
			Amulet of Yendor (a clear homage to	<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>); levels are procedurally generated and employ a grid-based structure, and the death of a player character means an absolute end to the 
			playthrough (i.e., "permadeath"). 
			<br><br>
			
			Compared to	<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> introduced improved features and mechanics to the new <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre, including things
			such as better enemy "AI" (artificial intelligence -- essentially improved code for how enemies interact with their surrounding environments and the player's character), an expanded character creation menu featuring selectable
			character classes, in-game shops where player characters can purchase items, and new mechanics such as the ability of a player character to eat corpses to gain their powers (Gailloreto, 2020).

			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moria_(1983_video_game)&oldid=1156544413'><em>Moria</em></a>, an abbreviated version of its full title, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>The Dungeons of Moria</em></span>, was developed 
			by Robert Alan Koeneke and released in 1983 ("Moria [1983 video game]," 2023). The player quest in <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span> takes inspiration from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with the ultimate
			objective of descending to the lowest depths of the dungeon to slay the final boss, the Balrog. Along with all of the traditional characteristics of a <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span>, 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span> helped to evolve the genre by expanding the size, shape, and depth of dungeon levels; by introducing a final boss villain (the Balrog), and giving player characters the ability to mine
			ore, among other features (Gailloreto, 2020).

		<h4><span style="color: #cfc041;">The Next Generation</span> // <em>Nethack</em> (1987), <em>Angband</em> (1990)</h4>
		<p style='margin-left: 30px;'><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">
			As the popularity of early roguelikes like <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> and <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span> took off,
			they, in turn, inspired their own spin-offs, leading to the development of <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span> and <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Angband</em></span>, respectively, as fans of the original games
			were inspired to create their <em>own</em> renditions of the genre, building upon the features and mechanics found in the originals. 
			<br><br>
		
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NetHack&oldid=1186597749'><em>NetHack</em></a> is actually a "fork" of the original source code for <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> ("NetHack," 2023). Mike Stephenson
			was the maintainer of the <em>Hack</em>	source code and was	inspired to create a new-and-improved iteration of the game. Stephenson teamed up with Philosophy professor Izchak Miller and computer hacker Janet Walz, and -- aptly naming 
			themselves the "DevTeam" -- the three set to work expanding and improving the <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> source code, naming their "fork" <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>"NetHack"</em></span> due to the nature
			of the DevTeam's collaboration on the game occuring over the Internet. The first version of <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span> was released on July 28, 1987. With <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span>, 
			the DevTeam introduced new player character classes, new enemies, new items, and new dangers for player characters to navigate, while maintaining the same player objective from <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Hack</em></span> -- to 
			retrieve the Amulet of Yendor -- and the core characteristics of the <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre (Gailloreto, 2020).

			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Angband_(video_game)&oldid=1197279330'><em>Angband</em></a>, developed by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand and released in 1990, in a fashion similar to 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span>, is itself a "fork" of the original <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span> ("Angband [video game]," 2024). 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Angband</em></span> has a similar structure to <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span>, but is instead set in the fortress, Angband, rather than the dungeons of Moria, and its primary 
			objective is for player characters to survive its 100 floors in order to defeat the final boss, Morgoth. <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Angband</em></span> built upon the original 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span> by expanding the size and complexity	of the original game, as well as introducing new features, such as a mechanic where player characters could encounter the undead corpse 
			of their previous characters as an enemy in new playthroughs.

			"tiles mode" for the Microsoft Windows operating system, which added sprites to represent characters and objects in the game, rather than relying on <em>ASCII</em> characters to display the game world.

		<h4><span style="color: #cfc041;">The Modern Roguelike</span> // <em>Caves of Qud</em> (2015)</h4>
		<p style='margin-left: 30px;'><span style="color: #b1c9c3;">
			In the years since the release of <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>NetHack</em></span> and <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Moria</em></span>, many different games have been developed drawing inspiration from the early days of the 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre, building upon its core characteristics and adding their own unique twists. Some games have tried to stay true to fundamental roguelike concepts such as "permadeath" and 
			procedurally-generated levels, but, in my opinion, only one game has truly managed to strike a balance between honoring the characteristics of traditional <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>roguelikes</em></span> and introducing unique 
			twists to those traditional concepts and mechanics of the genre -- that game is: <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span>.
			<br><br>
			
			<a href='https://www.cavesofqud.com/'><em>Caves of Qud</em></a>, developed by Freehold Games, released in "early access" (i.e., a playable state released to the general public, but with the clear
			intention of the developers to continue development of the game -- adding new features, refining graphics, etc.) on July 15, 2015 ("Caves of Qud," 2023). To quote the developers, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span> is both
			a <span style="color: #da5bd6;">science fantasy RPG</span> and a <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike epic</span> (Freehold Games, n.d.). 
			<br><br>
			
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span> manages to perpetuate the fundamental aspects of
			the <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre in the sense that the majority of the game world -- from its items and inhabitants, to large portions of its world, to the histories and relationships of its fictional towns and factions
			-- are randomly generated using advanced <a href='https://youtu.be/jV-DZqdKlnE?si=pZ3sfrEK4q1lbNm2'><span style="color: #cfc041;">procedural generation</span> techniques</a>; its default game mode adds 
			<span style="color: #cfc041;">"permadeath"</span> for player characters, all in-game operations are <span style="color: #cfc041;">turn-based</span>, with world elements updating on each keypress of the movement inputs;
			the world map is <span style="color: #cfc041;">grid-based</span>, and -- most importantly -- the game is a <span style="color: #cfc041;">"dungeon-crawl,"</span> albeit a "crawl" that happens across dozens of "mini-dungeons" in the
			forms of different towns, biomes, caves, and literal dungeons.
			<br><br>
			
			Despite staying true to its <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> roots, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span> has also managed to successfully incorporate many elements commonly found in other popular 
			game genres -- primarily <span style="color: #da5bd6;">role-playing games (RPGs)</span> --	by including features such as a rich narrative "main quest" serving as the thread of primary objectives during a playthrough, and an
			extensive character creation system that includes features such as selecting special traits, races, and character stats -- an element that is not foreign to the <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre, but which 
			<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span> implements in a form that falls much more in line with traditional RPGs. 
			<br><br>
			
			With its flawless fusion of both core <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> elements and 
			concepts and features from other genres	such as RPGs, <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span> has managed to become what I would confidently call the <span style="color: #00c420;">"epitomic roguelike"</span>, embodying
			the spirit of its <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> predecessors, while bringing the core elements up to modern standards and offering a fresh take on the genre.
			</span></p>

		<h3 align='left'># Concluding Thoughts</h3>
		<p align='left'>While the games that are listed here are not an exhaustive list of the entire <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> genre, I believe that they serve as the core thread in its history. From the early days of 
		<span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Rogue</em></span>, to the modern marvel that is <span style="color: #da5bd6;"><em>Caves of Qud</em></span>, the inspiration that has driven developers in the genre for decades -- a love for games, a love of computers,
		and a love for adventure -- has prevailed, inspiring a new generation of developers to bring fresh takes to the genre and push the boundaries of its defining elements, which likely explains

		To showcase just how popular and varied the roguelike genre has become in today's gaming industry, below is a ranked list of the eight (subjectively) best <span style="color: #da5bd6;">roguelike</span> games available as of early
